# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
#### To analyze the NYC Airbnb dataset, create visualizations and find interesting trends

## Process
#### connected and explored the NYC Airbnb dataset
#### create various visualizations to learn more about the dataset
#### Identified trends and created a story showing the most in demand neighborhood and apartment for potential Airbnb investors 

## Results
### Option 2 - Airbnb Dataset
#### I started out by trying to understand the number of Airbnb in NYC, the most popular neighborhoods and number of hosts in general.
#### Manhattan turned out to be the most in demand neighborhood and further analysis showed that the 1-bedroom Apartment were the most in demand and most highly priced.
#### The price forecast indicated an increasing trend with specific emphasis in Manhattan  

## Challenges 
#### Had to change beds from dimension to measures 
#### Some Zip codes were outside New York state
#### Encountered some warnings when trying to load host IDs due to the number of hosts

## Future Goals
#### would like to get more updated Airbnb datasets from NYC to verify the forecast
#### would like to have data on the running costs for these Airbnb to see how profitable it is
